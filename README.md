# Overview

I had a few reasons for choosing this dog breeder website as a project: 
learn Figma for planning, continue practice with HTML/CSS/Javascript, make the website more accessible and easier to navigate. 
And as a bonus: cute dogs.

The website before and after.

# Beginning

When I started this project, I wanted to figure out what to change so visitors would stay on it longer. And if I couldn't change very much, what would I focus on that would have the most immediate effect?

My thoughts:
- sticky the nav bar to the top (it was in the middle of the page over the content)
- create a functional mobile/tablet version
- change the colors, especially improve the low contrast between background and text
- clean up the section layouts for improved readability
- reduce the variety of fonts in use
- reduce large amounts of white space between sections for less meaningless scrolling
- make it possible to navigate only using keyboard


# Planning

I knew going in that I wanted to learn Figma to plan the design. 

My first mistake/lesson was creating a desktop site and then finding out that shrinking it to mobile wouldn't be as easy as I imagined. It quickly became cluttered and overwhelming in my attempts to squeeze the design into a smaller screen.

However, with each redesign I learned and improved, both in Figma and I think my design skills. If an element wasnâ€™t working quite right, it was easy to use Figma for testing out a few different ideas before committing it to the website.  

A progression to the current design (mobile view):

Keeping in mind that I don't know a good deal about SEO yet, I didn't want to change too much about the content. With the exception of a couple larger sections, like the puppy application (which could use its own dedicated form), everything was kept on the same page. 

It's been important for me to learn more about accessibility in web design, and I wanted to take it into consideration from the start. I'm still very new to it, but I tried applying what I've learned so far.

- utilized aria labels to hide purely decorative content from screen reader
- the menu can be accessed using keyboard
- the hamburger menu is a button element
- all buttons are button elements and not just stylized with css
- increased the contrast between the background and the text
- capitalized text and links versus writing them in all caps
- minimized distracting elements, such as the moving stars and sliding animations in the previous design
- contact form can be used with keyboard (in future, I would add clear error messages to the form)



# Finished

It's possible for me to go on further refining and experimenting, but I'm satisfied for now with the finished project. My end goal was to make the new website feel warm and inviting, but most important: easier to understand and navigate. My knowledge on everything from mobile-first design to screen readers (and of course puppies) definitely grew since the start. Thanks for your time! As always, I'm open to any feedback.
