# Overview

I had quite a few reasons for choosing this dog breeder website as a project: 
learn Figma for planning, continue practice with HTML/CSS/Javascript, make the website more accessible and easier to navigate. 
Bonus: puppy pictures.


# Beginning

When I decided to start this project, I wanted to know how to make the website easier to use so visitors stay on it longer. And if I couldn't change very much, what would I focus on that would have the most immediate effect?

My thoughts:
- sticky the nav bar to the top (it was in the middle of the page over the content)
- create a functional mobile/tablet version
- change the colors, especially improve the low contrast between background and text
- clean up the section layouts for improved readability
- reduce the variety of fonts in use
- reduce large amounts of white space between sections for less meaningless scrolling
- make it possible to navigate only using keyboard

Here's a short gif of the website before.

# Planning

Learning Figma. It was a journey. 

My first mistake/lesson was creating a desktop site and then finding out that shrinking it to mobile wouldn't as easy as I imagined. It quickly became cluttered and overwhelming in my attempts to squeeze the design into a smaller screen, while also deciding what to keep or throw out. 

I'm thankful I took the time to pick up Figma. If an element wasnâ€™t working quite right, it was easy to use for testing out a few different ideas before committing to it on the website. With each redesign I learned and improved, both in Figma and I think my design skills. 

A progression from the beginning to the current design:

Keeping in mind that I don't know much about SEO yet, I didn't want to change too much about the content. With the exception of a couple larger sections, like the puppy application (which could use its own dedicated form), everything was kept on the same page. 

It's been important for me to learn more about accessibility in web design, and I wanted to take it into consideration from the start. I'm still very new to it, but I tried applying what I've learned so far.

- utilized aria labels to hide purely decorative content from screen reader
- the menu can be accessed using keyboard
- the hamburger menu is a button element
- all buttons are button elements and not just stylized with css
- increased the contrast between the background and the text
- capitalized text and links versus writing them in all caps
- minimized extra distracting elements, such as the moving stars and sliding animations in the previous design
- contact form can be used with keyboard (in future, would add error messages)



# Finished

My goal for the end product was make it feel warm and inviting, but most important: easier to navigate and understand.
